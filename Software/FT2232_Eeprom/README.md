# FT2232 EEPROM Utility
Reads, writes and verifies the EEPROM attached to a FT2232 chip.

This can be useful for fixing Digilent HS1 programming cables when their EEPROMs 'lose' their contents.
We also have some Zybos that did the same.  What are these students doing....

You need a know good cable to copy the EEPROM from.
